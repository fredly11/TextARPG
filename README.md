# Overview

This program is a text-based RPG written in C# for the purpose of practicing C# syntax and class structure. The game uses the Windows Forms library to create 
a customizable console to act as the display and user interface. The display is centralized around an abstract Screen class that holds the data for what to render on the form and is used as the basis for some of the important game elements such as menus, locations, and NPC conversations. The program is designed to allow for designing any number of custom, interconnected locations, NPCs, and battles using the various types of Screen class.

# Development Environment

This program was created using the .Net Core platform and written in C#. I used Visual Studio Code as the IDE with the C# and .NET plugins.
This program uses the Windows Forms library and drawing library for creating the game screen, as well as the diagnostics library for debugging.
